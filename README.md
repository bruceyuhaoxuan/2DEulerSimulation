v0.0.1-alpha

Side Project. Built with C# under .Net 9.0 by Visual Studio 2022. A Simulation of 2D Euler Equations based on 1st Order Finite Difference Method. Variables need to be manually modified and recompiled. Uses Poisson's Equation for pressure calculation.

v0.0.2-alpha

Side Project. Built with C# under .Net 9.0 by Visual Studio 2022. A Simulation of 2D Euler Equations based on Finite Difference Method, the momentum density J is simulated using RK4 method for better accuracy over time. Variables need to be manually modified and recompiled. Uses Poisson's Equation for pressure calculation.

Ready to do:

1. Change the initial pressure to classic P = $\rho g h$ formula
2. Better outer boundary conditions
3. Add entropy calculation for pressure calculation for better simulation on compressible fluids
4. Adjust the project for Finite Volume Method for more accurate results that fit in thermodynamics
